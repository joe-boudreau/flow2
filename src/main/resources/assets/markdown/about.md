# Hey


My name is Joe, and I'm a software engineer based out of Toronto.


I enjoy coding, reading, and some other things. 


This domain serves as my online zen garden where I can write about the things that interest me.
I've mainly written book reviews over the last few years, but I'm starting to explore other topics as well.


Thanks for visiting. Shoot me an [email](mailto:joe@thejoeflow.com) if you want to chat.
